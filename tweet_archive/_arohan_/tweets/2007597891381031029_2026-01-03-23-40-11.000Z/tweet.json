  "text": "On a long flight, I finally decided to dive into what JEPA is all about. You can convert an encoder decoder into JEPA by the following:\n\n- target encoder replaced by moving average of encoder to avoid collapse\n- Use a projection to get a summary embedding, instead of token embedding for both input and target\n- use all the clever loss to avoid scale sensitivity \n\nIf you want tokens out, slap a decoder ontop of the summary representation. \n\nFeels like all of this could be an ablation.",
