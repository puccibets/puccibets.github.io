  "text": "As an AI expert who totally doesn't think LLMs are the path to AGI, but uses LLMs very avidly to get things done, here is my take on the utility of top LLMs currently: \n\n1) If you don't know what you're doing in a certain domain, you can get interesting and valuable results, but they will be mixed up with garbage and you'll have trouble identifying the garbage....   In some cases automated methods can be used to test/filter results but this remains mostly dodgy in real-world cases.\n\n2)  If you DO know what you're doing in some domain, but are NOT willing to creatively adapt your work-style to the LLMs, or are oriented toward proving the LLMs are dumb and flawed rather than making the most of them ... then you won't get much out of them except time-saving on some rote-ish tasks\n\n3)  If you DO know what you're doing in some domain and ARE willing to open-mindedly and creatively work with the LLMs to route around their shortcomings and leverage up their strengths, you can amplify your abilities and output DRAMATICALLY.. though still with some tradeoffs: in many respects LLM-assisted products are still not as good as expert-human-crafted products, though they are also often better in various respects (and can often be produced SO much faster)",
