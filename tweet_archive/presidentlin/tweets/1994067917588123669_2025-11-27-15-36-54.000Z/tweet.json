  "text": "Deepseek is such a cool lab.\n\nEvery time they see the open source community is struggling with something, they give their candidate answer and go back to the bottom of the oceans. \n\nReasoning models almost got locked up in private labs, OAI, and Sam are soooo good at deflecting, making whatever discovery seems super unreachable.\n\nDeepSeek comes, shares what they learn, next 6 months, everyone has the good stuff.\n\nEvery lab and its Dog has a thinking model, mostly thanks to them.",
