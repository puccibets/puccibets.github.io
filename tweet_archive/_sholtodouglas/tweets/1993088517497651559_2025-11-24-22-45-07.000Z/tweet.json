  "text": "Dario's essays and long debate slack threads are one of my favorite parts of Anthropic's culture. They're open, detailed - and incredibly raw. Everyone at the company ends up having a good sense of how the company is making decisions and what matters.\n\nIts the kind of thing that only works if you trust everyone at the company to engage in good faith and never leak information. A rare and precious thing.",
