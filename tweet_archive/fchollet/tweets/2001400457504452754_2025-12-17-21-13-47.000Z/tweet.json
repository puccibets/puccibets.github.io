  "text": "Because our universe follows stable laws, a sufficiently general intelligent system adapted to it, like human-driven science, can eventually model any phenomenon within it.\n\nHuman intelligence may not be \"universal\" in the mathematical sense (see No Free Lunch theorem), but we are perfectly adapted to decode the specific language of our universe. That's enough for us to be \"generally intelligent\".",
