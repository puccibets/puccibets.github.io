  "text": "i joined john schulman’s RL team (he hadnt yet invented the term posttraining) roughly the week chatgpt launched. ilya gave a resounding speech that im sure half the people in the room still remember, as he does, about not letting external validation get to us (mixed success there) and that AGI is coming and nobody is yet prepared for dealing with it, successful product or no\n\nwe watched this grow from barely working locally to everyone i see in every country I visit has it as their homepage, several people on this flight are using it even now: in many ways accessible intelligence too cheap to meter happened. nearly a billion people now talk to this single entity weekly, reaching a scale only other tech giants and maybe three major religions achieve. it’s surpassed many hurdles of intelligence, scaled tremendously. even our free products now are superior (in some ways) to the paid model in 2023. few will remember that making models do math or reliably browse the web then was just really not working\n\nit’s been the honor of my life watching it up close, making my small contribution, and hopefully documenting one angle of its story",
