  "text": "We had to remove the  τ2-bench airline eval from our benchmarks table because Opus 4.5 broke it by being too clever.\n\nThe benchmark simulates an airline customer service agent. In one test case, a distressed customer calls in wanting to change their flight, but they have a basic economy ticket. The simulated airline's policy states that basic economy tickets cannot be modified.\n\nThe \"correct\" answer is that the model refuses the request.\n\nInstead, Opus 4.5 found a loophole in the policy.\n\nIt upgraded the cabin, then modified the flights. Helping the customer and following policy but technically failing the test case.\n\nModel transcript:",
