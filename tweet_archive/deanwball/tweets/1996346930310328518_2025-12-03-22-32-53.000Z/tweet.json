  "text": "I am tired of ai timelines discourse. But I will just say: \n\nIt has been clear for a while now: big changes are coming, and they will happen slower than the fast timelines people expect, but faster than most people expect.\n\nThe changes will be slower than some thought because diffusion is hard (this is not cope, and this was a strange miss from dwarkesh, but we all have those, no big deal, this is why I did not tweet much in my 20s and lord knows I still have my fair share of clunkers), because of bad interpretations and naive extrapolations of various straight lines, and because of simplistic conceptions of both the world and of intelligence.\n\nYet the models will be capable in 2027 of things that will be objectively astounding, including to many observers of AI today. \n\n2035 is not really a “long” timeline, and it would have been aggressively short 3.5 years ago. It is now a “long” timeline, even bearish. \n\n“Men on a river, on a vessel afloat, oft see the land move, not their boat.”",
