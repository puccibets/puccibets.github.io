  "text": "perhaps I should have said opus 4.5 is the 4o of tpot rather than using iq. what I meant to say is that people with tons of context for ai--people who, if we're honest, wouldn't have touched 4o with a ten-foot pole (for the most part they used openai reasoners + claude or gemini for serious stuff, 4o was a google-equivalent at best for them)--are 'falling for' opus in a way they haven't for any other model. \n\nthey are like, \"my god, I feel like I am--no, *we* are-- creating genuinely excellent stuff, maybe even novel stuff, just me and the model. this model is a true partner in creation, and seems to have a real character and even perhaps a soul that I like.\" \n\nand then they go, \"my god, wait, doesn't that sound like the '4o people' I make jokes about on the internet? am I creating novel and high-quality things or am I also losing it?\" \n\nit's hard to know the answer. my conclusion is that the qualitative experience of living through the singularity will probably feel a little like going nuts if you are paying attention, and that more people are paying attention with time. \n\nI often joke that all good thinking about ai eventually stumbles back to the observation that all the ai company logos are swirls, vortexes. they will eventually grab you, is perhaps one day of thinking about it. 4o grabbed some. opus grabbed others (4.5 now and 3 before that). some of the grabbed were already prone to psychological problems, and perhaps in some cases the models amplified their problems.  but the models do not really 'cause' psychosis--at least I doubt it altogether. I suspect that almost everyone who has been 'grabbed' by any model has a productive and healthy relationship with the model, 4o people included. still, it is a new kind of human-computer interaction under the sun. \n\neventually more people will find something that causes them to 'dive in.' I sincerely doubt genuine insanity is on the other side for the vast majority of people who do, but you need to have pristine and ironclad cogsec to dive safely.\n\n\"leap into the boundless and make it your home!\" \n\nor as Cowen said, \"take the plunge.\"",
