  "text": "hilarious that a podcaster can have a change of heart about ai progress (from \"stupidly, comically, get-the-fuck-outta-here fast\" to merely \"the fastest technological progress trajectory of all time\") and that this can be a meaningful trigger for a meltdown in the vibes of a centibillion dollar industry\n\nthis is still a young, thinly institutionalized field. it's part of what makes it exciting! probably also part of why a guy in his early 30s and a substack can post his way to the yada yada yada\n\nvibes may be shifting back to \"too high expectations of immediate-term progress,\" but such is life.",
