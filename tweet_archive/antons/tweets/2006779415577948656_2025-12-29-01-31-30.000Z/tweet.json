  "text": "It’s been a couple of months since I read @steipete’s earlier post and decided to give Codex a try. \n\nIt clicked. My process has changed more than it has in the decade before, and I couldn’t be happier.\n\nI started writing code because I wanted to make apps for iPhone and Mac. It has never been the end goal, but a tool.\n\nCodex has allowed me to put much more energy towards the higher-level work, without getting bogged down by the minute details.\n\nFor the first time ever, I can do things as fast as I expect to. For the first time ever, I have time and energy to put into side projects.",
