  "text": "some quick observations on openai open roles\n\n1) there are about 100 open roles dedicated to core gtm and they are globally spread (united states, europe, singapore, japan, south korea, india, australia)\n\n2) this is the largest single area of recruiting right now at open ai; probably an important area of competition with azure, amazon, anthropic, google;\n\n3) openai is surprisingly focused on selling to major markets outside the us (excluding china, russia and middle east); they have partnership roles in india and japan (also communications role in japan)\n\n4) they are building out a standard enterprise sales pipeline of sales engineers, solution architects, and account directors\n\n5) there are 30 roles for forward deployed engineers attached to these sales teams spread across all the major jurisdictions\n\n6) this suggests that openai sees enterprise integration as one of the most important issues that they need to be able to solve for their customers to unblock sales; I think enterprise enablement is important here\n\n7) there are special roles that they are hiring for financial services and life sciences; both account directors and forward deployed engineers\n\n8) these are the only private industries with specific gtm and fde roles attached; it's interesting that they have no roles for legal or industrial; I'm curious what makes financial services and life sciences special\n\n9) there are another 5 roles just for us government sales, with the standard account director, solution architect, sales engineer organization; the us government is the only government with dedicated sales roles\n\n10) there is a lot of focus on their hardware device; it is a realtime device with cloud processing; they are hiring audio and camera engineers, focus on images for machine consumption\n\n11) it's clearly a device that you carry around because they are an hiring engineers responsible for crash simulation and thermal management simulation; and one of their image roles talks about images in motion\n\n12) they are hiring a bunch of roles to build their own gpus (rtl & codesign; verification; firmware; linux; optical); 1 engineer for AMD and 1 engineer for triton compilers; I feel like this emphasizes the importance of their internal gpu effort vis-a-vis amd or nvidia\n\n13) they are hiring for 3 or 4 robotics roles; electrical engineer for robotic hands, so they are doing the hardware, I think; and 2 simulation roles (simulation realism and simulation environment creation)\n\n14) it appears that they want to train robots in simulation using existing world engines (they call out nvidia isaac, unity and unreal engine - along with the now discontinued omniverse)\n\n15) obligatory, they are hiring engineers, they are hiring for pretty much every product, including sora; researchers for sora and human data; foundation researchers (although only a couple)\n\n16) they are hiring an m&a recruiter specifically to retain relationships with acquired employees - means they intend to do a lot of m&a and are worried about culture rejection",
