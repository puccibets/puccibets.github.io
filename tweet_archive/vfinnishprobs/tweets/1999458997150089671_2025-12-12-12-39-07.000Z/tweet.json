  "text": "Who the fuck are these MAGA clowns to lecture us Europeans about anything?\n\nThey live in a European ex-colony, under European-written laws, governed by a European-designed political system, speaking a European language, using a European alphabet, practising European concepts of rights, quoting European philosophers, celebrating European holidays, living inside European-mapped borders, with European surnames, and flying a flag based on European heraldic design.\n\nTheir entire nation is the plastic, theme-park replica of Europe. Instead of spouting bollocks about Europe, they should read a history book...ideally one with words as well as pictures.",
