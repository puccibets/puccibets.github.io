  "text": "an additional explanation re \"why models are so good at benchmarks but lag behind at economic impact\" is a sociological one.\n\neven if all the benchmarks are legit, models don't overfit them, and scores reflect actual utility, i suspect that these kind of \"intelligent\" tasks are just not where most of \"economic activity\" is at. \n\nthe intelligent tasks are just a small fraction of any worker's time, and there is a lot of extra overhead that cannot yet be automated. we may see more \"economic impact\" once the actual organizational workflows adapt to at least remove some friction from the current processes and streamline them for AI. and these things take some time.",
