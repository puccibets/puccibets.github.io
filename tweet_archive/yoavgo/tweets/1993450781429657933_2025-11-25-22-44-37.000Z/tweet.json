  "text": "the fascinating (to me) quality of hard-core RL researchers (e.g. Sutton, but also many others)  is the ability to have this very broad, all encompassing view of RL as the principle basis of intelligence, while at the same time working on super low level stuff like temporal differences algorithms in a tabular world, and yet strongly believe these are actually the same thing.",
