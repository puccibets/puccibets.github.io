  "text": "This sort of pikachu-facing over Daniel K's comment is embarrassing and obtuse.\n\nThe idea that the original claim of AI 2027 was \"AGI is going to happen definitely in 2027 and we'll all die if we don't do xyz\" cannot possibly come from a sane reading of the blogpost. I have a hard time believing roon is not confabulating this point on purpose.\n\nIf you have above a room-temperature IQ, instead of reducing their predictions to a concrete date, you can examine the accompanying PDFs they provided, which would project the arrival of SC (not AGI, go read the blogpost to understand) at a median of ~2028.\n\nThe thing is, a median of 2028, or even 2029, still leaves open the fairly likely (>10% chance) possibility of seeing the same thing by 2027. That makes it a reasonable possibility worth exploring; and that's exactly what that blogpost did.\n\nIf 2027 rolls around, and we are in that 10-20% likely scenario, we can't sit behind \"but we projected a median of 2029!\" to resolve the situation we would end up in. It is worth exploring, projecting, and preparing for.",
