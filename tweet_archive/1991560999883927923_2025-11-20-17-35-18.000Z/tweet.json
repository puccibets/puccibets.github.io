  "text": "Why Gemini 3 is a flop , despite the Codeforces/ICPC/IMO/putnam gold medals etc. \nImproving mathematical reasoning capabilities is like a plumber patching a leak. Imagine math reasoning as a d=20  dimensional ball. If we want to improve competition performance, we introduce data on a certain dimension then finetune/RL and that applies a patch of radius 0.5. If you want to cover the ball, you need 2^20 =10^6 patches, impossible. If you introduce data for IMO, nearby things on the same dimension (e.g. putnam) will considerably improve, but it won't help you pass a qual exam in statistics or do research in stats.\nNo amount of improvement in competition math will lead to being able to do math, statistics, optimization, MLAI theory research. It's on a different dimension.",
