  "text": "something I think the coding agents should add in 2026: MEMORIES(.)md.\n\nPretty much like ChatGPT memories, but for code projects. When I tell them \"that's good, but I want the API of `foobar` to strictly not change, redo it again without changing `foobar`.\" it should add \"don't change `foobar` API\" to MEMORIES(.)md so it will remember across sessions.\n\nIn principle, it's a lot like AGENTS(.)md, but I shouldn't have to keep adding stuff to it manually, the LLM agent should manage it continuously based on our interactions.\n\nThis also fits the now self-proclaimed theme of 2026 \"continual learning\". So yall should just do it @thsottiaux  @bcherny",
