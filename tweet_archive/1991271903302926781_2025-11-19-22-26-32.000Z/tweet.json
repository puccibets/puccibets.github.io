  "text": "just to be clear my bearishness on google was half jurisprudence & half the company just forgot to ship (sergey seems to have fixed this part). but the antitrust case had real teeth & it could’ve sentenced google to a decade of microsoft style paralysis where every product decision would’ve gotten laundered through regulatory fear of 2048 lawyers or something.\n\nbut the judge basically handed them a do whatever you must permission slip. so now you’re seeing google finally flex distribution in ways that would’ve triggered regulatory arrhythmia before. easiest example is the latest chrome right now which has two enormous megafauna sized buttons. one for gemini & one for ai mode… this would’ve basically given lina khan a heart attack like a year ago.",
