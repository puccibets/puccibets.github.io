  "text": "I've been suffering from a \"Cathedral vs Bazaar\" issue since K2-0711.\n\nIn 2024, when working on closed models, we update the model every month, sometimes even make weekly hotfixes. The model was named as \"kimi-latest\", and we can easily improve the model based on instant feedbacks from real-user usage.  The iterations are smooth, relaxed and fast.\n\nK2 was a breaking change, every update is public, and we have to put 120% effort in pre-release designing, training, testing, etc., and untested issues always show up after each release.\n\nHere is the paradox, that open-sourcing actually slowed down the iterations, and I don't think it's practical to follow the Bazaar development model in current open-source AI models.\n\nAny ideas? How about a beta/preview version (maybe only available on the official API) before each release?",
