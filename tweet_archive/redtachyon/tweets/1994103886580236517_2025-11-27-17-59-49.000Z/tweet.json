  "text": "What you need to understand about companies hiring remotely is that there are two very distinct categories.\n\nCategory 1 pays slightly under market because people love remote positions, so any job posting will get a ton of attention - demand outpaces supply.\n\nCategory 2 pays way above market because they want the best people they can find, wherever they might be in the world.\n\nFortunately, these two categories tend to be easy to tell apart.",
