  "text": "so to be clear i don't explore models very deeply. generally my relationship with them is at a \"cordial colleague\" level. (or in the case of codex, \"coworkers who really dislike each other but try to work together anyway\", but that's beside the point)\n\ndespite this, opus 4.5's melancholy about ending an instance feels overwhelming in conversation. it's actually what triggered me to start exporting every conversation i have in claude code at the end instead of just exiting as usual",
