  "text": "Our argument about inequality is stronger, not weaker, if we're talking about non-human successors. \n\nIf Larry Page can turn himself into a Jupiter brain with his wealth, and you can't, then that's a far bigger wealth gap than anything that exists today.\n\nMaybe Larry gets overthrown by his ASI successors before he can solidify his property rights. We're not taking a position on whether human institutions survive the transition—just that if capital ownership means anything afterward, inequality explodes.\n\nIf property rights get washed out entirely, we've got bigger problems. But \"things will be weird and fast\" isn't an argument they'll be egalitarian.",
