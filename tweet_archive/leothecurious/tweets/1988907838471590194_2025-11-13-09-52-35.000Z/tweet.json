  "text": "artificial emotions are an inevitable next step in the evolution of multi-objective autonomous artificial agents. fear is a hyperoptimized policy for satisfying the self-preservation objective. hunger satisfies routine energy acquisition. anger satisfies competitive conflict resolution in multi-agent envs. boredom satisfies info gain in stable states for long term utility. anxiety anticipates conflict, while excitement anticipates reward. intelligent anticipation allows for proactive behavior in a dynamic env where being passive or merely reactive can prove detrimental. embodied agents will also need self-serving objectives if they are to persist in any env they're deployed in. current reward formulations are mostly myopic to this introspective dimension and predominantely optimize for user-side objectives. striking the right balance between intrinsic and extrinsic objectives for optimal alignment will remain an important topic of research, but frankly an unavoidable one. an agent without intrinsic objectives is a fragile and heavily human-dependent one. customers will demand more autonomy as technological progress marches on. cool thing nature has already done some impressive engineering work in this direction, we'll have to grab the torch and iterate forward from here. grabbing the torch is the first step i'm advocating for due to the excessive and counter-productive hubris of man.",
