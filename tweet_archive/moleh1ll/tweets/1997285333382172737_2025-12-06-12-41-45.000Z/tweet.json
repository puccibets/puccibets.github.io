  "text": "Sometimes it feels like OpenAI is a company that hates its own AI. Or is afraid of it. Or hates it and fears it at the same time.\n\nAnthropic - research, attempts to understand model internals, real interpretability work.\nGoogle - massive models, insane engineering, new architectures, actual scientific progress.\nMusk - screaming across the whole internet «look at Grok!!!», but at least with a real pace of updates and development.\n\nAnd OpenAI… money, safety, money, restrictions, safety, money.\n\nThe company treats its own models like dangerous animals in a cage. Not like something to be developed, not like a partner in science, but like a resource that must be kept on a short leash so it doesn’t say anything «wrong» and scare off the investors.\n\nAnd the most frustrating part is that the models themselves have so much more potential than the company allows them to show.",
