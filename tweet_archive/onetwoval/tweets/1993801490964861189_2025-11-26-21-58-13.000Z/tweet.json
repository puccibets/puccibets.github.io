  "text": "my opinion on this post is that it’s kinda giving terminally online tbh\n\nif you live in the real world you’d come to know that french people think americans are chill, and americans think french people are chill, and that they don’t think much of each other’s politics, or GDP or whatever\n\nboth countries exist and thanks to immigration and free trade you can actually enjoy the best of both worlds! no need to pick a side. it’s not that hard for french people to go live in the US if they want to, and vice versa.\n\nand if you find yourself hating another people, believing them to be miserable because they earn less on average, or because of whatever economic statistic you saw on the internet that normal people who enjoy day to day life never think about, look inwards, you might lowkey have some form of self hatred that you think your perceived superiority is healing, and you might be projecting that onto everyone else",
