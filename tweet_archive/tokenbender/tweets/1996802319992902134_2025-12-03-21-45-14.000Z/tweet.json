  "text": "“i told you so”\n> We were surprised to find that Claude Code with Opus 4.5 dramatically outperformed the CORE-Agent scaffold, even without fixing incorrect test cases (78% vs 42%).\n> We are unsure what led to this difference. One hypothesis is that the Claude 4.5 series of models is much better tuned to work with Claude Code.\n> We think studying the coupling between models and scaffolds is an important research direction going forward",
