  "text": "happy 2026 my friends, greetings from shinjuku.\n\na reminder: \n(1) the brain is a computer\n(2) all computer programs can be reduced to a series of simple logical operations\n(3) such programs can be simulated by any other computer, given sufficient time and memory\n(4) we have likely built sufficiently powerful computers to rival the human brain\n(5) what we don’t know is the computer program which emulates the human brain\n(6) our very naive algorithms, like large scale text pretraining, have already reasonably much of what we classify as key points of human intelligence. we’re remarkably far along for how early we are\n(7) the code for gpt-4 fit in 500 lines of python code, so does the code for CoT reasoning. with reasonably high certainty: the ASI code likely fits in under 1000 lines of python. the secrets of superintelligence are hiding in your laptop, all you have to do is get it out\n(8) there are under 1000, likely under 250 serious researchers in the world who have the resources, correct philosophy, and conviction to tractably work on this problem today. this number grows exponentially every year\n(9) happy 2026",
