  "text": "2026 AI predictions:\n\n1. Continual Learning solved\n\n> Dario and Sholto Douglas from Anthropic hinting they have a solution. “Nested Learning” paper from GDM with Hope arch and TITANS.\n\n2. Models self-verify\n\n> Noam Brown had a post saying he expected models to get much better at this soon. Will help a ton with reliability/hallucinations. An area where models got much better in 2025.\n\n3. Further exponential gains from continued scaling of pre/mid/post training and RL\n\n> Gavin Baker said on “Invest Like the Best” that we still haven’t seen the first Blackwell trained model from a major lab. Moore’s law keeps chugging.\n\nThere will be problems.\nWe will solve them.\nWe always have.\n\nUltimately true AGI will bring immense benefit to your life. It will help you solve real problems, create the life you want and make you more prosperous.\n\nWildly optimistic.\nYes, I know.\nIt’s authentically how I am.\n\nAGI will lead to all humans smiling a lot more often.\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!",
