  "text": "Different people are wired differently, but I basically agree.\n\nSalesforce and Oracle were indeed built by money-motivated men. But Apple and Twitter were art projects. SpaceX and Tesla were engineering feats. And Bitcoin and Zcash are ideological campaigns.\n\nSo: money is a metric, but not the only one, and the “capitalism” part of technocapitalism has been stressed a bit too much in recent times. Because the drive to make great art, to advance science, to win in a just cause, will always produce more peak energy than the merely pecuniary. But then, on a daily basis, you have to eat too.\n\nI think of it like cross country skiing. Sometimes you’re advancing with the right ski, and sometimes the left. So when the cause hits a setback, at least there’s a paycheck. But when there is no paycheck, you are driven by the righteousness of your cause.",
