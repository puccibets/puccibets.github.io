  "text": "The President is right: trying to govern a national technology through fifty divergent state codes weakens America’s AI capacity and leaves every American worse off. A patchwork slows innovation, fractures interstate commerce, and hands strategic advantage to competitors.\n\nThe executive branch has real tools to encourage a constitutional, effective federal framework—one that protects citizens, supports our economy, and advances American values while delivering the abundance AI promises. The previous administration’s sweeping AI order pushed in the wrong direction. President Trump reversed course and is taking steps to restore coherence, predictability, and national purpose in AI policy.\n\nStates have a vital role in addressing concrete harms, but only Congress and the President can safeguard national priorities in technologies that operate across borders and at global scale. We look forward to reviewing the EO and supporting efforts to bring clarity and American leadership back to U.S. AI policy.",
