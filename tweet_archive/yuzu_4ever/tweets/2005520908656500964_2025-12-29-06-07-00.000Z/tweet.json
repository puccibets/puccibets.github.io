  "text": "okay i tried claude code and it's useful but nowhere near as transformative as people are making it out to be. you can ignore everyone on twitter and come to your own conclusions by trying it.\n\nmaybe if you're a software engineer it's different, but it doesn't benefit me in any real way for my research. tbh all the hype makes me think that software engineering must be pretty easy. i write a lot of code, but most of the hard work is thinking about the mathematical models themselves, not the structure of the code.\n\nit's a lot more consistent with making all of the edits that i ask for which is really nice. they're still way worse at math and spatial reasoning than gemini 3 pro. it does poorly any code related to these types of problems. \n\ni will probably switch to using claude code instead cursor for certain things, but disappointed over all.",
