  "text": "I don't think Jerry is leaving AI research. He's just going to another lab. These kinds of decisions are always extremely personal to the high-value employee. You work all day on AI research. You want to implement ideas X and Y.  Your company is going in a different direction. You go out to lunch with your ex-boss who works at another lab, and he is REALLY excited about ideas X and Y.  Etc.\n\nI think everyone is overindexing on OpenAI having to serve the consumer market and mistakenly assuming that this has now become the main goal.  No, obviously not.  IMO, OpenAI and Anthropic are basically doing the exact same thing, except OpenAI has more resources and is obligated to spend a portion of these resources on the consumer market.",
